Repository for all the projects (and some notes maybe) of the course Computing Methods for Experimental Physics.
Here all the assignments will be tracked and will be accessible to the public.

The folder `latex` contains the source code of the notes converted from markdown to latex, and it aims to become the basis for a future handnotes notebook of the course.
A future good idea would be to make an analytic index inside the handnotes and to make a sort of cheat sheet for python for future usage.
